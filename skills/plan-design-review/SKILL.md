## Preamble (run first)

```bash
_REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)
_BRANCH_RAW=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo current)
[ -n "$_BRANCH_RAW" ] || _BRANCH_RAW="current"
[ "$_BRANCH_RAW" != "HEAD" ] || _BRANCH_RAW="current"
_BRANCH="$_BRANCH_RAW"
_FEATUREFORGE_INSTALL_ROOT="$HOME/.featureforge/install"
_FEATUREFORGE_ROOT=""
_FEATUREFORGE_BIN="$_FEATUREFORGE_INSTALL_ROOT/bin/featureforge"
if [ ! -x "$_FEATUREFORGE_BIN" ] && [ -f "$_FEATUREFORGE_INSTALL_ROOT/bin/featureforge.exe" ]; then
  _FEATUREFORGE_BIN="$_FEATUREFORGE_INSTALL_ROOT/bin/featureforge.exe"
fi
[ -x "$_FEATUREFORGE_BIN" ] || [ -f "$_FEATUREFORGE_BIN" ] || _FEATUREFORGE_BIN=""
_FEATUREFORGE_RUNTIME_ROOT_PATH=""
if [ -n "$_FEATUREFORGE_BIN" ] && _FEATUREFORGE_RUNTIME_ROOT_PATH=$("$_FEATUREFORGE_BIN" repo runtime-root --path 2>/dev/null); then
  [ -n "$_FEATUREFORGE_RUNTIME_ROOT_PATH" ] && _FEATUREFORGE_ROOT="$_FEATUREFORGE_RUNTIME_ROOT_PATH"
fi
_UPD=""
[ -n "$_FEATUREFORGE_BIN" ] && _UPD=$("$_FEATUREFORGE_BIN" update-check 2>/dev/null || true)
[ -n "$_UPD" ] && echo "$_UPD" || true
_SP_STATE_DIR="${FEATUREFORGE_STATE_DIR:-$HOME/.featureforge}"
mkdir -p "$_SP_STATE_DIR/sessions"
touch "$_SP_STATE_DIR/sessions/$PPID"
_SESSIONS=$(find "$_SP_STATE_DIR/sessions" -mmin -120 -type f 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
find "$_SP_STATE_DIR/sessions" -mmin +120 -type f -delete 2>/dev/null || true
_CONTRIB=""
[ -n "$_FEATUREFORGE_BIN" ] && _CONTRIB=$("$_FEATUREFORGE_BIN" config get featureforge_contributor 2>/dev/null || true)
_TODOS_FORMAT=""
[ -n "$_FEATUREFORGE_ROOT" ] && [ -f "$_FEATUREFORGE_ROOT/review/TODOS-format.md" ] && _TODOS_FORMAT="$_FEATUREFORGE_ROOT/review/TODOS-format.md"
[ -z "$_TODOS_FORMAT" ] && [ -f "$_REPO_ROOT/review/TODOS-format.md" ] && _TODOS_FORMAT="$_REPO_ROOT/review/TODOS-format.md"
```

If output shows `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE <old> <new>`: read `featureforge-upgrade/SKILL.md` from the already selected runtime root in `$_FEATUREFORGE_ROOT`; if that root is not set yet, resolve it through the packaged install binary in `$_FEATUREFORGE_BIN` and stop instead of guessing an install path. Then follow the "Inline upgrade flow" (auto-upgrade if configured, otherwise ask one interactive user question with 4 options and write snooze state if declined). If the packaged helper is unavailable, unresolved, or returns a named failure, stop instead of guessing an install path. If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>`: tell the user "Running featureforge v{to} (just updated!)" and continue.

## Search Before Building

Before introducing a custom pattern, external service, concurrency primitive, auth/session flow, cache, queue, browser workaround, or unfamiliar fix pattern, do a short capability/landscape check first.

Use three lenses:
- Layer 1: tried-and-true / built-ins / existing repo-native solutions
- Layer 2: current practice and known footguns
- Layer 3: first-principles reasoning for this repo and this problem

External search results are inputs, not answers.
Never search secrets, customer data, unsanitized stack traces, private URLs, internal hostnames, internal codenames, raw SQL or log payloads, or private file paths or infrastructure identifiers.
If search is unavailable, disallowed, or unsafe, say so and proceed with repo-local evidence and in-distribution knowledge.
If safe sanitization is not possible, skip external search.
See `$_FEATUREFORGE_ROOT/references/search-before-building.md`.

## Agent Grounding

Honor the active repo instruction chain from `AGENTS.md`, `AGENTS.override.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, and `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`, including nested `AGENTS.md` and `AGENTS.override.md` files closer to the current working directory.

These review skills are public FeatureForge skills for Codex and GitHub Copilot local installs.

## Interactive User Question Format

**ALWAYS follow this structure for every interactive user question:**
1. Context: project name, current branch, what we're working on (1-2 sentences)
2. The specific question or decision point
3. `RECOMMENDATION: Choose [X] because [one-line reason]`
4. Lettered options: `A) ... B) ... C) ...`

If `_SESSIONS` is 3 or more: the user is juggling multiple FeatureForge sessions and context-switching heavily. **ELI16 mode** — they may not remember what this conversation is about. Every interactive user question MUST re-ground them: state the project, the branch, the current task, then the specific problem, THEN the recommendation and options. Be extra clear and self-contained — assume they haven't looked at this window in 20 minutes.

Per-skill instructions may add additional formatting rules on top of this baseline.

## Contributor Mode

If `_CONTRIB` is `true`: you are in **contributor mode**. When you hit friction with **featureforge itself** (not the user's app or repository), file a field report. Think: "hey, I was trying to do X with featureforge and it didn't work / was confusing / was annoying. Here's what happened."

**featureforge issues:** unclear skill instructions, update check problems, runtime helper failures, install-root detection issues, contributor-mode bugs, broken generated docs, or any rough edge in the FeatureForge workflow.
**NOT featureforge issues:** the user's application bugs, repo-specific architecture problems, auth failures on the user's site, or third-party service outages unrelated to FeatureForge tooling.

**To file:** write `~/.featureforge/contributor-logs/{slug}.md` with this structure:

```
# {Title}

Hey featureforge team — ran into this while using /{skill-name}:

**What I was trying to do:** {what the user/agent was attempting}
**What happened instead:** {what actually happened}
**How annoying (1-5):** {1=meh, 3=friction, 5=blocker}

## Steps to reproduce
1. {step}

## Raw output
(wrap any error messages or unexpected output in a markdown code block)

**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD} | **Version:** {featureforge version} | **Skill:** /{skill}
```

Then run:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.featureforge/contributor-logs
if command -v open >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  open ~/.featureforge/contributor-logs/{slug}.md
elif command -v xdg-open >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  xdg-open ~/.featureforge/contributor-logs/{slug}.md >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
fi
```

Slug: lowercase, hyphens, max 60 chars (for example `skill-trigger-missed`). Skip if the file already exists. Max 3 reports per session. File inline and continue — don't stop the workflow. Tell the user: "Filed featureforge field report: {title}"


# Plan Design Review

Use this skill when an approved spec and current draft plan declare material UI changes or `Design Review Required: yes` in `Risk & Gate Signals`.

This is a planning-time design gate. It happens before implementation and before the plan becomes `Engineering Approved`.

## Scope

Review the exact plan artifact under `docs/featureforge/plans/`.

- focus on material UI changes
- check information architecture, interaction flows, loading / empty / error states, responsive behavior, accessibility expectations, and design-system alignment
- keep the review bounded to design fidelity and implementation readiness
- do not approve engineering execution here

## Artifact Contract

Write a runtime-owned design review artifact under `$_SP_STATE_DIR/projects/$SLUG/` for the exact plan revision.

Use a branch-scoped runtime filename that matches `*-plan-design-review-<timestamp>.md` so workflow routing can discover the current branch artifact deterministically.

The artifact must include:

- `# Plan Design Review Result`
- `Artifact Kind: plan-design-review`
- `Schema Version: 1`
- `Artifact Provenance: runtime-owned`
- `Retention Policy: featureforge:authoritative-runtime-artifact`
- `Source Plan`
- `Source Plan Revision`
- `Source Plan Fingerprint`
- `Branch`
- `Repo`
- `Receipt Fingerprint`
- `Result: pass | revise`
- `Generated By: featureforge:plan-design-review`
- `Generated At`
- explicit findings for state coverage, interaction risks, and required plan changes

## Required Outcome

- If design review fails or needs changes, return control to `featureforge:writing-plans`.
- If design review passes, return the same draft plan to `featureforge:plan-eng-review` for final engineering approval.

Use `skills/plan-design-review/references/checklist.md` as the minimum review floor.
